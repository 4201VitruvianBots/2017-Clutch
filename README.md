# 2017-Clutch

Java Code for our 2017 Robot, Clutch.

For the 2017 FRC Competition season, we used LabVIEW for our code, which can be found here (Link to be added). During the offseason bewteen 2017-2018, our team decided to switch to Java. This repository contains our replicated code, with some differences.
